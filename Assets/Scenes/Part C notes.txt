I decided to extend the provided cellular automata code by allowing the user to choose the colors and tick rate of the game through the script attached to the cube. Note that the tick rate must be a positive even integer; if it's not, the script will throw an exception. Also note that, due to reasons beyond my comprehension, the cube will sometimes fail to display the living cells and appear entirely dead. To fix this, fiddle with the RGB sliders for the "Alive" color and test to see whether the game shows up. Continue doing this until the game reappears, then reset the sliders to the color you were originally trying to get and run again. The "Dead" color does not seem to affect whether the game succeeds or fails to display.

Also, the game doesn't seem to display at all in the build. I'm not sure why this is.
